This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug involving the use of the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using modern React Native lifecycle methods.  The issue stems from attempting to set state within `componentWillMount`, which is no longer supported and can lead to unexpected behavior, such as inconsistent rendering. The solution replaces `componentWillMount` with `useEffect`, ensuring proper state updates and avoiding deprecated methods. The code includes clear explanations and comments to guide developers through the problem and its solution.
