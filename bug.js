This React Native code snippet uses the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method.  This method is no longer supported and can cause unexpected behavior.  The code attempts to set the state within `componentWillMount`, which can lead to rendering issues and inconsistencies.

```javascript
componentWillMount() {
  this.setState({ data: 'some data' });
}
```
